        <h3>What is intermittent fasting?</h3></div>
    <div>
        
        <p>Fasting Tracker is the most popular fasting app trusted by users all over the world.</p>
        <p>No diet and no yo-yo effect. Reach your goal weight, get healthy and feel full of energy.</p>
        
        <p>Intermittent fasting is one of the most popular health and fitness trends. Instead of a diet, it's an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating. It doesn't specify which foods you should eat or avoid, but when you should eat.</p>
        <p>Today, we eat 3–4 (or more) meals per day, and never feel hungry. This requires our organs to work hard all the time, and never take a break from digesting. Our eating habits may result in obesity and health problems, such as diabetes.</p>
        <p>When fasting, your body will detoxify, burn fat and regenerate. After a few weeks, you'll feel healthier and more active.</p>
